Due to time constraints, this was done as per spec

- There is no checking/error handling around exception cases (E.G. files not existing)
- There is no parameter validation or association tests
- The code is however structured in such a way that everything is unit testable
- The console application was given minimal attention, I.E. there is no validation/error handling
